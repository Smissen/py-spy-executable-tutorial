Well lets start with installing py-spy

`pip install py-spy`{{execute}}

Now that we have py-spy installed we can verify it and the version by running

`py-spy --version`{{execute}}

So what can py-spy do well there is three subcommands that we can use and those are `top`{{}} `dump`{{}} and `record`{{}} and we will be going into those three now.
