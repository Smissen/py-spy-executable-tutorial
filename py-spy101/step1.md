We'll start with installing py-spy by running this command.

`pip install py-spy`{{execute}}

If you were to install it later on a Mac, you can use Homebrew instead with this command `brew install py-spy`.

Now that we have py-spy installed, we can verify the installation and also check the version by running.

`py-spy --version`{{execute}}

Now that we have py-spy working, we can go into how to use it. There are three commands avaiable, these are `top`{{}}, `dump`{{}} and `record`{{}}. We'll now go through each of them.
