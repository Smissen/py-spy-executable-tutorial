## Record subcommand
The `record`{{}} subcommand can be called in one of two ways.
```
py-spy record -o output.svg --pid <PID>
# OR
py-spy record -o output.svg -- python executable.py
```
We can also use the `-f`{{}} flag to change the output format and by default it generates a flamegraph in a svg but you can also choose `raw`{{}} and `speedscope`{{}} and we will be using the `-f raw`{{}} because Killercoda does not have any sort of display. `speedscope`{{}} is used to generate files in JSON which can be used by the Speedscope profiler which we will not be diving into today.

Also of import is that the flag `-o`{{}} does not need to be used but py-spy will autogenerate the filename without it so we use it for comfort.

## Prereqs
(This is almost optional, since you can copy the whole svg file and open it on your computer instead if you want to make sure to not use `-f raw`{{}} in that case so you get it in a svg format)

Because there is no display here we will be using an terminal viewer for seeing the flamegraphs. So start by running this

`git clone https://github.com/4rtzel/tfg`{{exec}}

We have now gotten the terminal flame graph viewer (tfg) which is also written in python there is other alternatives but this is the one that we will be using, if you are interested in reading about it you can do so here `https://github.com/4rtzel/tfg`

## Using Record

We will start by running record on our program `exampleprogram.py`{{}} and since we will be using `tfg`{{}} to view it we will make sure to use `-f raw`{{}}

`py-spy record -o output.txt -f raw -- python exampleprogram.py 38`{{exec}}

Once this has finished running we will open the generated by running

`tfg/tfg.py -t pyspy output.txt`{{exec}}

The flamegraph will look like this and it is a visualization of hierarchical data, created to visualize stack traces of profiled software so that the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately.

And here we can move around with the arrowkeys to see what is being called and by what.
When we feel satisfied we can exit by pressing `q`{{}}
