## Learning Outcomes
This executable tutorial aims to show how you can use py-spy to be able to profile and monitor your codebase, to easier be able to find problematic code and get a better overview of where your code is spending most of it's time, and which parts may be problematic.

We hope that you will be able to use py-spy in your DevOps work, and hopefully be able to utilize it after this tutorial.

## Prerequisites
Basic Python Knowledge
Some Basic Knowledge about using a terminal (UNIX commands, we will be using Ubuntu here)

## Motivation
Py-spy is crucial for DevOps as it provides real-time, low-overhead profiling of Python applications in both development and production. It enables teams to diagnose performance issues on live systems without requiring restarts or code changes, ensuring minimal disruption. Py-spyâ€™s ability to attach to running processes helps quickly identify bottlenecks, supporting rapid debugging and optimization. This makes it ideal for maintaining performance and reliability throughout the CI/CD pipeline, aligning perfectly with DevOps goals of speed, automation, and continuous improvement.
